What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
    I found Unit Testing slightly confusing but when it catches an error it's really helpful, but trying to find how to go about finding each bug was a bit difficult.
What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    First thing I would do in the future is find all the moments that would pass a bug, then work from there so that you have all the moments.
